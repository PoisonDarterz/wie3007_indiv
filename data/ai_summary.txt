- Income & Credit Activity: There's a very strong positive correlation (0.94) between monthly income and monthly credit. This indicates that higher income is closely tied to increased credit activity, suggesting income significantly influences credit usage or availability.
- Financial Balance Stability: The very strong positive correlation (0.91) between starting and ending balances highlights that initial financial health largely determines the final financial position. A strong starting balance is a key indicator of a healthy ending balance.
- Credit Score Persistence: An individual's initial credit score has a strong positive correlation (0.70) with their final credit score. This suggests that an established creditworthiness tends to be consistent over time.
- Income & Initial Financial Standing: Monthly income is strongly correlated (0.68) with the starting balance. This implies that higher earnings often contribute to a more robust financial position at the beginning of a period.
- Investment Performance: Higher monthly investment return percentages are strongly linked to greater monthly investment gains (0.68 correlation). This underscores the importance of achieving a good return rate for maximizing investment growth.
- Spending vs. Earning: On average, monthly debits (6235.75) significantly exceed both monthly income (3866.87) and monthly credit (4757.02). This suggests that individuals in this dataset may be spending more than they are earning or receiving through credit each month.
