- Income and Credit Activity: There is a very strong positive correlation (0.94) between monthly income and monthly credit activity. This indicates that higher-income individuals tend to have substantially more credit flowing into their accounts.
- Account Balance Stability: An individual's starting balance is a powerful predictor of their ending balance, with a correlation of 0.91. This suggests that account balances are relatively stable or follow a consistent trend over the period observed.
- Data Quality/Anomalies: A significant 15.2% of the records contain anomalies (76 out of 500 rows). This high number warrants further investigation into potential data quality issues or unusual financial behaviors.
- Spending vs. Income: Average monthly debits (6235.75) significantly exceed both average monthly income (3866.87) and credit (4757.02). This suggests that many individuals are spending more than their current income and credit inflows, potentially relying on savings or other financial resources.
- Credit Score Predictability: An individual's initial credit score is a strong predictor of their final credit score, with a correlation of 0.70. While some change is possible, credit scores tend to show considerable stability over time.
- Income's Impact on Balances: Higher monthly income is strongly correlated with a higher starting account balance (0.68). This indicates that a greater income generally contributes to a stronger foundational financial position.
