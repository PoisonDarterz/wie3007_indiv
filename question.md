## WIE 3007 – Data Mining (Financial Analytics Focus)

### Assignment – AI-Assisted Exploratory Data Mining

**Due Week 9**

---

## Objective

Apply data-mining techniques and modern AI tools — Generative AI (GenAI), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs) — to simulate, explore, and preprocess financial transaction and investment data. Students will learn to combine traditional data-mining workflows with AI-driven insights.

---

## 1️⃣ Dataset Simulation using GenAI (3 marks)

Create a synthetic dataset of **500 retail-banking customers (or investors)** tracked over one month.
Each record should include:

* Customer ID
* Age / Income / Occupation
* Daily transaction amounts (credit, debit)
* Account balance trend
* Investment returns (%)
* Credit score
* Short customer feedback or financial note (text)
* Date / timestamp

Use Generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral, etc.) to:

* Generate realistic spending and investment patterns
* Introduce credit score variations
* Create textual customer feedback (e.g., “I plan to increase my savings next month.”)
* Include missing or noisy data

---

## 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with LLM Insights (4 marks)

Perform EDA using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), including:

* Summary statistics
* Distributions
* Correlations
* Anomaly detection

Then use an LLM to interpret the results in plain English, for example:

> “Summarize the relationship between income and investment return.”

Include AI-generated summaries of major financial insights.

---

## 3️⃣ Data Preprocessing using LLMs / SLMs (4 marks)

Clean and prepare the dataset:

* Handle missing values
* Normalize features
* Encode categorical variables
* Use models to process text fields

Text tasks may include:

* Sentiment classification (positive / neutral / negative)
* Topic detection (savings, loan, investment, etc.)
* Imputation of missing text fields

---

## 4️⃣ AI-Assisted Summary Report (4 marks)

Prepare a **2–3 page report** including:

* Data simulation approach
* EDA visualizations
* Preprocessing techniques
* Business insights
* Example AI prompts and generated responses

---

## Deliverables

1. **Jupyter Notebook**

    * Code for data simulation, EDA, and preprocessing
    * Embedded AI interactions

2. **Short Report (PDF/DOCX)**

    * Visualizations
    * AI summaries
    * Key findings
